<h5>Full Stack Developer</h5>
<p>
A motivated Full-stack Developer who seeks growth by consistently learning, unlearning, and relearning. I have over four (4) years of experience in Web and Mobile development and have worked on challenging and engaging projects that required me to work outside my knowledge set. Also, convert business/user requirements into maintainable and scalable code. My technical expertise includes fluency in Dart (framework: Flutter), React, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python Django, GitHub actions unit testing using Flutter, and much more. I have been instrumental in the planning and development process of applications I worked on either single-handedly or as part of a team. I pay strong attention to details and commitment to delivering quality results. I am well-talented and well-positioned to contribute to any project I engage with as a proactive team player
