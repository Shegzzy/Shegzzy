### Hi there 👋
<hr>

My name is Alabi Micheal Segun
<hr>

Full Stack Developer
I am an open-minded and motivated Full-stack Developer who seeks continual growth by consistently learning, unlearning, and relearning. I have over four (4) years of experience in Web and Mobile development and have worked on challenging and engaging projects that required me to work outside my knowledge set. Also, convert business/user requirements into maintainable and scalable code. My technical expertise includes fluency in Dart (framework: Flutter), VueJs, NodeJs and PHP, knowledge in continuous integration and deployment/delivery using GitLab CI, building REST API, Codemigic, GitHub actions unit testing using Flutter, and much more. I have been instrumental in the planning and development process of several applications I worked on either single-handedly or as part of a team. You can reach me via email at benpaul320@gmail.com.
